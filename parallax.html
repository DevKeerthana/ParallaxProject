                <p class="para_2">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 
                    eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard
                     (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising 
                     two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores 
                     runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with 
                     the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling
                      and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball
                       from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) 
                       and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal
                        include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and 
                        dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching 
                        the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the 
                        ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can 
                        cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have 
                        been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. 
                        The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire
                         and match referee in international matches. They communicate with 
                         two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.</p>
